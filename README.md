_printf
_printf is a basic implementation of the printf function that is written in C. It is a team project that was developed to understand the inner workings of the printf function and how to replicate it.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine and include the _printf.c and _printf.h files in your project.

Usage
To use _printf in your project, include the _printf.h header file and call the _printf function with a format string and any additional arguments specified by the format string.

Copy code
#include "printf.h"

int main(void)
{
    _printf("Hello, %s\n", "world");
    return (0);

%c: for character
%s: for string
%%: for the % character
